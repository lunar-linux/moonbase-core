Wget - Retrieves files from the Web

Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the Web using
http and ftp, the two most widely used Internet protocols. It works
non-interactively, so it will work in the background, after having
logged off.

The program supports recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as
well as ftp sites-- you can use wget to make mirrors of archives and
home pages or to travel the Web like a WWW robot.

Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
by continuing to retrive a document until the document is fully
downloaded.  Re-getting files from where it left off works on servers
(both http and ftp) that support it. Both http and ftp retrievals
can be time stamped, so wget can see if the remote file has changed
since the last retrieval and automatically retrieve the new version
if it has.

Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.
