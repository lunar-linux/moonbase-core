cat << EOF
Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language.
It combines remarkable power with very clear syntax, and isn't difficult to
learn. It has modules, classes, exceptions, very high level data types, and
dynamic typing. There are interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as
well as to various windowing systems (Tk, Mac, MFC, GTK+, Qt, wxWindows).
Newbuilt-in modules are easily written in C or C++. Python is also usable as
an extension language for applications that need a programmable interface.
