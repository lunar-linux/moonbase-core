cat << EOF
libusb-compat-0.1 is a replacement for libusb-0.1. However, instead of being an
actual implementation, libusb-0.1 is more of a compatibility layer (or wrapper)
which just converts libusb-0.1 calls into their libusb-1.0 equivalents.

It aims to look, feel and behave exactly like libusb-0.1. As it is a
replacement, you cannot install it alongside libusb-0.1 on the same system.

As the compatibility layer implements the exact same ABI and API, no
modifications to existing libusb-0.1-based applications are needed. You do not
even have to recompile them. This compatibility layer is a drop-in replacement.
