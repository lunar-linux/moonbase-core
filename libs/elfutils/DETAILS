Elfutils is a collection of utilities, including ld (a linker), nm (for
listing symbols from object files), size (for listing the section sizes
of an object or archive file), strip (for discarding symbols), readelf
(to see the raw ELF file structures), and elflint (to check for
well-formed ELF files).  Also included are numerous helper libraries
which implement DWARF, ELF, and machine-specific ELF handling.
