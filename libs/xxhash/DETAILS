           SHORT="Extremely fast non-cryptographic hash algorithm"

cat << EOF
xxHash is an extremely fast, non-cryptographic hashing library that processes
data at RAM speed limits. It offers three algorithms: XXH32 (32-bit), XXH64
(64-bit), and XXH3/XXH128 (64 or 128-bit with vectorization).

The library generates hash values with excellent dispersion and randomness
properties, making it ideal for hash tables, bloom filters, and checksums.
All variants pass the SMHasher test suite for quality assurance.

Performance: XXH3 achieves 31.5 GB/s bandwidth on SSE2, significantly
outperforming cryptographic alternatives.

Provides: libxxhash.so library and xxhsum command-line utility
License: Library (BSD), xxhsum utility (GPL2)
