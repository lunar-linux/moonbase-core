           SHORT="A library for manipulating Unicode strings and C strings"

cat << EOF
This library provides functions for manipulating Unicode strings and
for manipulating C strings according to the Unicode standard.

It consists of the following parts:

  unistr.h     elementary string functions
  uniconv.h    conversion from/to legacy encodings
  unistdio.h   formatted output to strings
  uniname.h    character names
  unictype.h   character classification and properties
  uniwidth.h   string width when using nonproportional fonts
  uniwbrk.h    word breaks
  unilbrk.h    line breaking algorithm
  uninorm.h    normalization (composition and decomposition)
  unicase.h    case folding
  uniregex.h   regular expressions (not yet implemented)

libunistring is for you if your application involves non-trivial text
processing, such as upper/lower case conversions, line breaking, operations
on words, or more advanced analysis of text. Text provided by the user can,
in general, contain characters of all kinds of scripts. The text processing
functions provided by this library handle all scripts and all languages.

libunistring is for you if your application already uses the ISO C / POSIX
<ctype.h>, <wctype.h> functions and the text it operates on is provided by
the user and can be in any language.

libunistring is also for you if your application uses Unicode strings as
internal in-memory representation.
