readline - Lets users edit command lines as they are typed in
The Readline library provides a set of functions for use by applications
that allow users to edit command lines as they are typed in. Both Emacs and
vi editing modes are available.
The Readline library includes additional functions to maintain a list of
previously-entered command lines, to recall and perhaps reedit those lines,
and perform csh-like history expansion on previous commands.
