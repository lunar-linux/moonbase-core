           SHORT="Perl compatible regular expression library"

cat << EOF
The PCRE library is a set of functions that implement regular expression
pattern matching using the same syntax and semantics as Perl 5, with just a
few differences. PCRE was originally written for the Exim MTA, but is now used
by many projects including Python, Apache, Postfix, KDE, Analog, PHP and Ferite.
