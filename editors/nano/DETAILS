cat << EOF
The nano project was started because of a few problems with the wonderfully
easy-to-use and friendly Pico text editor. GNU nano features:
 * Autoconf support.
 * Truly free license (GNU GPL).
 * Goto-line# command w/o flag.
 * Case sensitive search function.
 * Interactive search and replace.
 * 2/3 - 1/8 size of Pico binary.
 * Slang and ncurses support.
 * Autoindent abillity.
 * Displayed tab width option.
 * Regular expression search and replace.
 * Toggles for cmdline flags via Meta keys.
 * Tab completion when reading/writing files.
The main disadvantage is lack of mailer integration, but this is also a
strength. GNU nano aims to emulate Pico and perhaps provide extra functionality.
