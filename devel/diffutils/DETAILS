diffutils is a group of utilities that displays difference between and
among text files.
 * diff  - outputs the difference between two files in any of several
           formats. If the files are identical, it normally produces
           no output; if they are binary (non-text) it normally
           reports only that they are different.
 * cmp   - shows the offsets and files numbers where two files differ;
           it can also show, side by side, all the characters that
           differ between the two files.
 * sdiff - merges two files interactively.
 * diff3 - shows differences among three files. If two people have
           made independent changes to a common original, diff3
           reports that difference between the original and the two
           changed versions, and can produce a merged file that
           contains both persons' changes along with warnings about
           conflicts.
