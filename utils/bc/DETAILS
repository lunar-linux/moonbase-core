bc is an arbitrary precision numeric processing language. Syntax is
similar to C, but differs in many substantial areas. It supports
interactive execution of statements. bc is a utility included in the
POSIX P1003.2/D11 draft standard.
This version does not use the historical method of having bc be a
calculator for the dc calculator (the POSIX document doesn't specify how
bc must be implemented). This version has a single executable that both
compiles the language and runs the resulting 'byte code.' The byte code
is not the dc language.
