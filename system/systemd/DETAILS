cat << EOF
systemd is a system and session manager for Linux, compatible with SysV and LSB
init scripts. systemd provides aggressive parallelization capabilities, uses
socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of
daemons, keeps track of processes using Linux cgroups, supports snapshotting and
restoring of the system state, maintains mount and automount points and
implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic.
It can work as a drop-in replacement for sysvinit.
