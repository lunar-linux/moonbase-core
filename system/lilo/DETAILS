Lilo is a Boot loader for Linux/x86 and other PC operating systems.
Lilo is responsible for loading your Linux kernel from either a floppy
or a hard drive and giving it control of the system. It can also be used
to boot many other operating sysetms, including the BSD variants, DOS,
and OS/2. The Lilo distribution includes full source, documentation
and support files, but no pre-compiled binaries. Lilo is capable of
booting beyond cylinder 1024 of a hard disk if the BIOS supports EDD
packet call extensions to the int 0x13 interface.
